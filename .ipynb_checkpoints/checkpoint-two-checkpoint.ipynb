    "\n",
    "* id: A unique number identifying an Airbnb listing.\n",
    "* host_id: A unique number identifying an Airbnb host.\n",
    "* host_name: Name of the host.\n",
    "* neighborhood: A subregion of the city or search area for which the survey is carried out. \n",
    "* latitude: Listing latitude\n",
    "* longtitude: Listing longtitude\n",
    "* room_type: One of “Entire home/apt”, “Private room”, “Shared room”, or \"Hotel room\".\n",
    "* price: The price (in $US) for a night stay.\n",
    "* minimum_nights: The required minimum stay for a visit, as posted by the host.\n",
    "* number_of_reviews: The number of reviews that a listing has received. Airbnb has said that 70% of visits end up with a review, so the number of reviews can be used to estimate the number of visits. Note that such an estimate will not be reliable for an individual listing (especially as reviews occasionally vanish from the site), but over a city as a whole it should be a useful metric of traffic.\n",
    "* last review:  Date of last review\n",
    "* reviews_per_month: The number of reviews that a listing has received per month.\n",
    "* calculated_host_listings_count: The total number of listings for a particular host.\n",
    "* availability_365: The number of days for which a particular host is available in a year\n",
    "* number_of_reviews_ltm: The number of reviews within last month\n",
    "* license: If host is licensed. According to the law, specific short-term rentals require a license.\n",
    "* host location: Where the host is located.\n"
